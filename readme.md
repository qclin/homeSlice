What if we live in the middle of nowhere? 

with a desire to see the world without troubling over the next destination

Can the Internet take us ? randomly to wherever it've already recorded . . . 

to see the sky, the street, and the scenery that we've long lust.

When google respond. . . are we able to tell where we've landed? 

Will we guess Connecticut for Croatia, Tennessee for Taiwan? 

Are we going to doubt our pre-conceptions or question this virtual engine? 

For producing these foreign yet familiar places.
