What if we live in the middle of nowhere? 

& with a desire to see the world without having to think of the next destination? 

can google streetview take us ? randomly to wherever it've already been . . . 

to see the sky, street, and scenery that we've long lust.

When google respond. . . are we able to tell where we've landed? 

Will we guess Connecticut for Croatia, or Tennessee for Taiwan? 

Are we going to doubt our preconceptions or question google's virtual engine? 

For producing these foreign yet familiar places.
